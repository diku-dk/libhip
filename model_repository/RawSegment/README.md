This folder contains the initial 3D representation of the 2D bone labelmaps. These meshes are typically dense and may have poor qualities; 
Thus, we need to improve the quality and resize the triangles before using them. 

You can find the cleaned and re-meshed bone models for all the subjects in the [CleanSegment](https://github.com/diku-dk/libhip/tree/main/model_repository/CleanSegment) folder.
